I have to say, congratulations. It's certainly not easy. And the fact that you are looking for a guide to do well on your first day is even better. I couldn't find too many well-rounded resources on how to manage the first day, and the ones I did find had cliche points like \"just be yourself\". I'm going to cover the important cliches along with tips specific to the computer science profession. Let's get started!",n.default.createElement("br",null),n.default.createElement("br",null),n.default.createElement("h4",{className:"blog-subtitle-sub"},"1. Show Up Early"),"It may frighten you a bit when I tell you that most people will only remember you by your first and last impressions. These first few tips will help you master the first impression. To start, you should arrive on the first day ten to fifteen minutes early. As an intern you should come early every day, but, if you aren't a morning person, just focus on getting there early on the first day.",n.default.createElement("br",null),n.default.createElement("br",null),n.default.createElement("h4",{className:"blog-subtitle-sub"},"2. Dress Nice Even If You Don't Have To"),"The rule of thumb here: No dress code? Dress business casual. Business casual? Dress semi-formal. Semi-formal? Dress formal. Formal? Come in a tailored tuxedo. Just kidding about the last one, but, definitely dress to impress. On your first day you're going to be meeting a lot of people, so you should dress above average to the dress code. But if there is no dress code, don't come in a suit. That's overdoing it!",n.default.createElement("br",null),n.default.createElement("br",null),n.default.createElement("h4",{className:"blog-subtitle-sub"},"3. Get Introduced To Everyone In Your Department"),"This should happen automatically on your first day, but if not, ask your manager or boss to introduce you to everyone. You don't want to be three weeks in and still haven't said hello to the one quiet engineer that likes to work in the back of the room. Get introduced and this will also make you feel 10x more comfortable talking to the people around you from day to day. You don't need to memorize everyone's name right away but definitely make the effort to! If you're on your computer or writing in a notebook while you're talking to someone new, write their name down.",n.default.createElement("br",null),n.default.createElement("br",null),n.default.createElement("h4",{className:"blog-subtitle-sub"},"4. Stay Late for Genuine Conversations"),"This tip is an addition to the first and third. Something I noticed at my internship is that when I stay late, it opens the opportunity to have genuine conversations with other employees. How? Well, if you stay late then eventually you are going to be in the office with just one or two other people. Since the work period is over, you'll be able to talk to these people about all kinds of things, and what's cool is that it doesn't have to be work related. Deep conversations with others will take your relationships to new levels. This benefits everyone, work will be a lot more enjoyable when you're deeply connected with those around you!",n.default.createElement("br",null),n.default.createElement("br",null),n.default.createElement("h4",{className:"blog-subtitle-sub"},"5. Sit Towards The Middle (Avoid The Back)"),"If you get to choose where you would like to sit, pick somewhere towards the middle of the office. Somewhere with a lot of traffic. This will give you more opportunities to interact with your co-workers. In the long run, sitting in the middle will also mean you will have more accountability to stay engaged every day. If you sit in the back then it will be easier to get distracted and daydream about spontaneously buying a ticket to fly to the other side of the world.",n.default.createElement("br",null),n.default.createElement("br",null),n.default.createElement("h4",{className:"blog-subtitle-sub"},"6. Ask A Low Quantity Of High-Quality Questions"),"This is important. When you are at your new internship, you need to realize that you can only ask so many questions. You are supposed to ask a lot, but at the same time, you also need to really think a question before you ask it. Is this question something that you could've figured out by clicking one more article on Google? Is this question something you asked after only trying to figure it out for two minutes? If you answer yes to either of these, then think twice before asking it. Most of your initial interactions with other employees will begin by asking a question, so make sure your questions are high-quality. If you ask a series of ignorant questions, then the people around will naturally see you as less competent. Put a lot of thought and effort into the questions you ask.",n.default.createElement("br",null),n.default.createElement("br",null),n.default.createElement("h4",{className:"blog-subtitle-sub"},"7. Do What The Employees Do"),"During your first week, be aware of the routines that all the employees are taking part in. For example, do they post their work updates daily to something? Do they do stand-ups with the manager with their updates? Eventually, you will have to take part in a lot of these activities. If you go and ask the manager how you can get involved before they ask you, this shows initiative and that you take your performance seriously. Also, figure out the tools that the employees use in order to stay organized. Make sure you fully utilize these tools.",n.default.createElement("br",null),n.default.createElement("br",null),n.default.createElement("h4",{className:"blog-subtitle-sub"},"8. Follow Up With Thank Yous"),"During the time you initally met your company to your first day, chances are you've met a lot of different people in the company in the process. After you have successfully been onboarded, you should take the time to thank all of these people. They have done a significant amount of work to get you on the team, and more importantly, they believe in you! Don't forget to follow up with a thank you email, or if they are in office, walk up to them and tell them thank you."))))};t.default=r,e.exports=t.default}});
