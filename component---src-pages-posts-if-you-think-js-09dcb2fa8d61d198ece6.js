Your career, family, friends, sleep schedule, fulfillment, the list goes on and on. But, you clicked on this article so you may be curious as to why I am addressing those who think they have their lives together. Well, if you think you have your life together, I want to ask you something. And if you haven't done this, then, in my opinion, you certainly do not have your life together. Let us start.",n.default.createElement("br",null),n.default.createElement("br",null),"Are your parents still around? Do you have a healthy relationship with them? If you answered yes to both of these then you are truly blessed. You should never take this for granted. The presence of your parents (or lack of) has played a massive role in the person you have become today. Now that you are all grown up, you have many things to worry about. A lot of time to grow independently. There is so much going on in your life that you most likely will check up on your parents and visit them every once in a while, but not much more than that.",n.default.createElement("br",null),n.default.createElement("br",null),"There's more to it though. You have a responsibility. My question for you is: Are you keeping up with your parents' lifestyle? Are they making healthy choices from day to day? Chances are, they could use some improvement. You could say \"You can't teach an old dog new tricks\" but if you really think about it, you've probably have overcome some pretty formidable obstacles in your life. How hard could it really be to change your parents' lifestyle now while they still have the majority of their health together? I'm asking that you take control of your parents lifestyle now so you can prevent severe tragedy in ten or twenty years.",n.default.createElement("br",null),n.default.createElement("br",null),"Living in America, it is now the default that your parents will get some kind of vicious illness like cancer, heart disease, a stroke, Dementia, Alzheimer's, the list goes on and on. I've lost one grandma to cancer, the other to diabetes and dementia from a stroke, my grandfather passed away from dementia. I have to tell you, these weren't the simple \"old age\" passings. These were decade-long tragedies that tore apart my family. It's so hard to see a loved one slowly lose all of their memories until they can do nothing but smile. My grandmother passed away earlier this year after chronic dementia for 10+ years and while we all loved her very much, this was certainly a relief for my family, mainly my mother. My mom took care of my grandma for countless years and it was so tough on her. She would drive to see her almost every day and to see her own mother in that state, all I can say is that it's certainly tragic. The role of a caretaker for the disabled elderly is one of the most draining roles in life when it happens to involve your own mother or father, and I wouldn't wish it upon my worst enemy.",n.default.createElement("br",null),n.default.createElement("br",null),"So what can you do in order to prevent the tragedy of seeing your own parents fall victim to one of these terminal illnesses? Well first, understand that the body is an amazing healer.

Do they consume fruits and vegetables? My personal favorite habit that my parents have continued for over a year now is eating a salad every day. I'm not going to explain all the scientific evidence because I'm not a nutritionist, but if you do some research you'll learn that a salad can provide the body with essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Eating a large salad before dinner will also keep them feeling full throughout the rest of the night. Figure out how to make a salad that's appealing and then present it to your parents. A salad a day will have a monumental effect on your parents' health in the long term.",n.default.createElement("br",null),n.default.createElement("br",null),n.default.createElement("h3",{className:"blog-subtitle-sub"},"Two) Seven or more hours of sleep"),"This is something that my mom specifically struggles with. How are your parents sleeping? Are they getting a sufficient seven to eight hours of sleep? A sleep-deprived lifestyle is a lifestyle that ages the body at an extreme rate.

Watch it ",n.default.createElement("a",{href:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwaWilO_Pig"},"here"),". If your parents get a small amount of sleep every night and they can't seem to break the habit, make sure they speak to their doctor about it.

It's certainly hard to start and even harder to maintain the habit of exercise. My advice for getting your parents active is to get them to try a new hobby. My parents recently started biking together. My dad bought himself a nice bike and now he goes on long voyages. He's the lightest he's been in ten years. Exercise will do wonders on the body. Really think about your parents and what you could imagine them doing for exercise, even just going for walks a couple times a week will help so much down the road.",n.default.createElement("br",null),n.default.createElement("br",null),"If you were to implement these three habits in your parents' lives, or even simpler versions of them, it could set them up not only them for a long, happy, and healthy life...
