College teaches you theoretical computer science, but you're on your own when it comes to learning the relevant (and employable) technologies. In order to be successful in this field, you have to turn yourself into some sort of machine. You have to be able to hold focus for a long time, you have to make a lot of sacrifices with your time, there are all kinds of things I'm doing now that I never thought I'd be willing to two years ago. But as I devote most of my time towards bettering myself in my career, I also spend a lot of time looking from the outside in. It's so easy to get lost in this vortex of work day in and day out. It seems like all my ambitious colleagues have signed away their twenties, destined to spend every second working hard and aspiring to get as much money as possible, and then they will buy a house, car, and live comfortably.",i.default.createElement("br",null),i.default.createElement("br",null),"This entry isn't meant to complain about how our capitalistic society lures people into working away the most valuable years of their life, but instead, I'd like to share with you my vision for my twenties. To start, I'd like to make an observation. My generation was born into this mind-fuck of smart technology. I don't know what it's like to not have an iPhone. I don't know what it's like to not be typing from my MacBook Pro. When I was born however neither of these technologies existed. But in just my lifetime, technology has come such a long way. Medicine is on the same route, it's hard to imagine what life will be like in fifty years for our personal longevity. I, however, imagine the future to be a science fiction fantasy and with it comes a dramatic increase in our life/health span. I'll confidently say in front of thousands of people that I believe I'll live to two hundred years old. I bring up this point because you're only in your twenties for ten years. It's worth really planning out how you want to spend those years.",i.default.createElement("br",null),i.default.createElement("br",null),"Another transformation I believe we're making as humans is a transformation towards remote work becoming the default. I enjoy keeping up with the digital nomad movement, and I think that if you learn the right skills, a remote job that pays comfortably won't be so hard to obtain. I'd like to leverage my skills in computer science and spend my twenties working remotely around the world. Remote jobs aren't only becoming more plentiful, but the infrastructure for supporting remote work lifestyles is also being built by the billions of dollars as we speak. Coworking spaces seem like amusement parks for ambitious twenty-somethings on the move. You basically pay a couple of hundred dollars a month to be a member at a space that has the resources and network you need to succeed. The members in these spaces come from all over the world, just imagine who you'd meet.",i.default.createElement("br",null),i.default.createElement("br",null),"The last point I have to make about how I see the rest of my twenties is something philosophical. It's something that I think about regularly. I was fortunate to be born in America, the land of opportunity. It may have taken me a while to get accustomed to this game we all play here, but now that I understand it, I'm getting more and more confident that I'll succeed in this life. And with anything, if you start succeeding and stay persistent, your effort starts to compound and only more and more wins will accumulate. But, before I bite down onto the pursuit of the American Dream, I remember that there are different ways of living all over the world to discover, and who's to say that climbing ladders is the game that's best for me. I feel compelled to travel the world because I'd like to see these other games that people are playing. And who knows, maybe I'll find something more fulfilling and you'll never see me again.",i.default.createElement("br",null),i.default.createElement("br",null)))))};t.default=r,e.exports=t.default}});
